## About this project

This project is a simple dating app.
It allows the user to register by clicking on the "Sign Up" button. To register, you need to fill in the form.
The form has a validator that allows you to use a password of at least 6 characters, the nickname must be from 3 to 20 characters, the email must be written in a specific form. If the validation requirements are not met, the user is notified of this, and registration is performed only after the correct filling of the form.

A registered user can log in to the app by clicking on the "LogIn" button. After authorization, "Me" and "Profile" tabs becomes available to the user. In "Me" tab, user can see the data entered by him during registration. The user can edit this data and completely delete his profile.

The "Profiles" page contains a list of all registered users (their nicknames). By clicking on the desired nickname, the user receives all available information about the person (except for the name and password). On the "Profiles" page, you can reactively search for users by nickname, and it is enough to enter only a part of the nickname.

## Reflection and use of time
- work lasted about 100 hours 
- difficulties arose at every stage:
it was tricky to get the Crude function to work correctly (get, change, delete). Reactive search also caused problems.
Failed to implement the idea of uploading photos by users 
- When working with css, bootstrap allowed you to add your own styles only to the template file, which is not very convenient.
- Failed to create a multi-page registration form, requires knowledge of reactive forms
